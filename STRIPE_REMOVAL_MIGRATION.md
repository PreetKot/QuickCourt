# Stripe Removal Migration

## Changes Made

This migration removes all Stripe-related code and dependencies from the QuickCourt project, keeping only Razorpay as the payment gateway.

### Files Modified:

1. **server/package.json**
   - Removed `stripe` dependency

2. **server/src/config/env.ts**
   - Removed `stripeSecretKey` and `stripeWebhookSecret` configuration
   - Kept only Razorpay configuration

3. **server/.env.example**
   - Removed Stripe environment variables
   - Kept only Razorpay variables

4. **server/.env**
   - Removed Stripe API keys
   - Kept only Razorpay configuration

5. **package-lock.json**
   - Automatically updated to remove Stripe dependencies

### Verification:

- ✅ No Stripe imports found in codebase
- ✅ No Stripe references in TypeScript/JavaScript files
- ✅ No Stripe environment variables
- ✅ No Stripe packages in dependencies
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ All payment functionality uses Razorpay exclusively

### Next Steps:

1. Test the application to ensure all payment flows work with Razorpay only
2. Update any deployment scripts if they referenced Stripe environment variables
3. Remove any Stripe-related monitoring or alerting configurations from production

### Benefits:

- Simplified codebase with single payment provider
- Reduced bundle size (removed Stripe SDK)
- Cleaner environment configuration
- Focus on Razorpay integration quality
